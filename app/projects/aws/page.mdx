    <p>
      At AWS I worked on two closely related areas: <strong>Amazon RDS for SQL Server</strong> (managed relational
      databases) and <strong>AWS Marketplace</strong> (seller reporting & analytics). The focus was on
      security-sensitive database features and reliable reporting pipelines for large sellers.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        On <strong>RDS for SQL Server</strong>, I contributed to TLS/cipher configuration, led the initial design for
        linked servers on RDS Custom, and helped harden SSAS as a managed option.
      </li>
      <li>
        On <strong>AWS Marketplace</strong>, I improved the ETL and operational guardrails behind seller usage and
        revenue reports so data arrived consistently and with clear guarantees.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      On the RDS SQL Server team I worked on features that made the managed service a better fit for regulated and
      enterprise workloads, especially around network security and connectivity.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>TLS and cipher configuration:</strong> Co-designed and implemented support for configuring TLS versions
        and cipher suites through DB parameter groups, so customers could disable legacy protocols (for example TLS
        1.0/1.1) and meet their compliance baselines without custom scripting.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Linked servers on RDS Custom:</strong> Led the initial design for enabling linked servers from RDS
        Custom for SQL Server to other engines (SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL, etc.), defining the security model,
        credential storage, and driver-management story that the team later used for the public launch.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>SSAS support hardening:</strong> Helped stabilize SQL Server Analysis Services as an RDS option by
        fixing bugs and extending tests around provisioning, authentication, and backup/restore flows.
      </li>
    </ul>

    />
    <p>
      In AWS Marketplace I worked on the reporting stack that generates usage, billing, and revenue reports for
      Marketplace sellers, with a focus on making the pipelines more predictable and support-friendly.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>ETL pipeline improvements:</strong> Contributed to Kinesis → Glue → Athena pipelines that transform raw
        usage events into seller-facing CSV reports, tightening data contracts and handling late or duplicated events
        more gracefully.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Operational guardrails:</strong> Added validations, retries, and alarms around report generation and S3
        delivery so issues surfaced early and could be attributed to a specific stage instead of appearing as opaque
        report failures.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Customer experience:</strong> Worked with PMs and support to align the system’s behaviour with
        documented SLAs and expectations (for example when data is considered complete for a given period).
      </li>
    </ul>

  <ProjectSection title="What I Focused On (Engineering Notes)">
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Secure configuration surfaces:</strong> Designing TLS/cipher configuration as a first-class managed
        feature rather than a one-off script, so security teams could treat RDS SQL Server like any other hardened
        asset.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Working with database engineers:</strong> Collaborating with SQL Server experts on feasibility and
        performance for linked servers and SSAS support, then turning their constraints into clear API and UX
        trade-offs.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Reliability and debuggability:</strong> Instrumenting Marketplace reporting pipelines so data issues
        were observable in metrics and logs instead of surfacing as mysterious gaps in seller dashboards.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Documentation and handover:</strong> Writing internal and external docs that clarified how to use the
        features safely and how the underlying systems behaved in edge cases.
      </li>
    </ul>
