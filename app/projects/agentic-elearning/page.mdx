    <p>
      LearnPath is an agentic e-learning tool that turns a learner’s goal (for example, “prepare for event-driven
      microservices interviews”) into a structured, multi-week learning path.
    </p>
    <p>
      It uses semantic search (RAG) to find high-quality resources, then generates lesson plans and quizzes whose
      questions are grounded in those materials.
    </p>
    <p>
      The system is built as a realistic multi-service AI application with Next.js, Go, Python/FastAPI, Qdrant, and
      Postgres.

  <ProjectSection title="Key Features">
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Agentic learning planner:</strong> Learners specify a goal, time budget, and weekly capacity. The system
        orchestrates LLM calls to generate a realistic multi-week learning plan with lessons, milestones, and estimated
        effort.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Semantic resource discovery (RAG):</strong> A Qdrant-based vector index and semantic search identify
        relevant articles, guides, and tutorials for each topic. Results are displayed with match scores and links to
        original sources.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Grounded lesson plans &amp; quizzes:</strong> Each lesson includes curated resources and an AI-generated
        quiz. Questions are created from the underlying materials so they remain grounded and explainable.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Progress tracking &amp; dashboard:</strong> A dashboard aggregates all learning paths, showing total
        hours, estimated weeks, active plans, and completion status.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Production-style architecture:</strong> The Next.js frontend talks to a Go API gateway, which fans out to
        Python/FastAPI services for planning, RAG, and quiz generation, using Postgres and Qdrant as backing stores.
      </li>
    </ul>

    />

    <h3>Set Your Goal</h3>
    <p>
      Tell us what you want to learn and your available time budget. Our AI analyzes your goal and creates a structured
      learning path with milestones and resources.
    </p>

    <h3>Curated Resources</h3>
    <p>
      Get relevant articles, videos, and tutorials from trusted sources. We use semantic search to find the best learning
      materials matched to your specific needs.
    </p>

    <h3>Test Your Knowledge</h3>
    <p>
      Take AI-generated quizzes to verify your understanding. Each lesson includes a quiz with questions directly cited
      from the learning materials.
    </p>

  <ProjectSection title="Discover Resources with Semantic Search">

      alt="Search page showing results for “Microservice architecture” with relevance scores and links to resources discovered by semantic search."
      caption="Semantic search over a Qdrant vector index powers resource discovery for technical topics."
    />
    <p>
      The Search page lets learners explore the resource catalog with semantic search. Instead of simple keyword
      matching, the system uses vector embeddings in Qdrant to find articles, guides, and tutorials that are
      conceptually related to the query (for example, “microservice architecture”). Each result shows a match score and a
      direct link to the resource.
    </p>

  <ProjectSection title="Turn a Goal into a Structured Learning Plan">
    <ProjectScreenshot
      src="/images/projects/learnpath/lp-3-plan.png"
      alt="Form for creating a learning plan with fields for learning goal, time budget, hours per week, prerequisites, and a Generate Learning Plan button."
      caption="Create-plan form that feeds the planner service to generate a multi-week learning schedule."
    />
    <p>
      To create a plan, the learner specifies their goal, total time budget, hours per week, and any prerequisites they
      already have. The planner service then calls an LLM to design a realistic schedule, breaking the goal into lessons
      and weeks while keeping within the time constraints.

  <ProjectSection title="Track Progress Across All Your Learning Paths">

      caption="Dashboard summarizing a learner’s overall activity and giving quick access to each path."
    />
    <p>
      The dashboard summarizes a learner’s overall progress across multiple plans. It shows the number of active plans,
      total hours invested, estimated weeks of study, and completion statistics. Each learning path card highlights key
      details such as topic, estimated duration, and quick access to the plan.

      caption="Lesson-level view of an Event-Driven Architecture path, including curated resources and a quiz entry point."
    />
    <p>
      Each learning path drills down into lessons and resources. For example, an “Event-Driven Architecture” path
      includes lessons like “EDA Fundamentals,” with multiple curated resources per lesson. A progress bar at the top
      tracks completion so learners can see how far they’ve gone.
    </p>
    <p>Each lesson section surfaces:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Topic title, such as <code>EDA Fundamentals</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        A list of curated resources under <code>Resources:</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        A <code>Take Quiz</code> button leading to the grounded quiz for that lesson
      </li>
    </ul>

  <ProjectSection title="Test Understanding with AI-Generated, Grounded Quizzes">

      alt="Quiz page showing multiple-choice questions about event-driven systems with radio-button answers."
      caption="Quiz page with multiple-choice questions generated directly from the underlying learning resources."
    />
    <p>
      For each lesson, LearnPath generates multiple-choice quizzes directly from the underlying learning materials. The
      questions are grounded in the source content, which makes the quiz explainable and helps prevent hallucinations.
      This supports spaced repetition and gives learners immediate feedback on what they have actually retained.

  <ProjectSection title="What I Focused On (Engineering Notes)">
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Agentic orchestration:</strong> The system is structured so that different services handle goal analysis,
        planning, resource retrieval, and quiz generation. The frontend interacts with a Go gateway that orchestrates
        calls to Python/FastAPI services and external LLMs.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>RAG pipeline:</strong> Resource metadata and text are embedded and stored in Qdrant. Semantic queries are
        combined with filters, and match scores are exposed in the UI so users can see how relevant each resource is.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Grounding &amp; safety:</strong> Quiz questions are generated only from known resources, so answers can
        always be traced back to a source. This mirrors retrieval-augmented generation patterns used in production
        systems.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Scalable architecture:</strong> The application is designed as a set of independently deployable services
        (Next.js frontend, Go gateway, Python microservices, Qdrant, Postgres), suitable for containerized deployment on
        platforms like Railway and Vercel.
      </li>
