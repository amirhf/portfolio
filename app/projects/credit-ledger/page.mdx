# Credit Ledger — Event‑driven accounting (Go + Postgres)
**Win:** Production patterns for money‑like flows: CQRS, transactional outbox, idempotent consumers, observability.
## Problem
Money/credits require invariants, auditability, and failure‑safe messaging.
## Approach
Go services; Postgres + projections; outbox table + relay; retry‑safe consumers; Swagger for testing; Jaeger/Grafana.
## Outcome
Clear blueprint teams can clone/run; showcases senior design trade‑offs.
